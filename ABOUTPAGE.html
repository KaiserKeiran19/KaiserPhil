    <td>My name is Keiran Bhalla. I grew up in Singapore, however, right now live in the US.
    At the time of writing this, I am 18 years old
    and I am a freshman in university. I am planning on declaring a major in Philosophy but am unsure about a minor.
    </td>
    <td>I am writing about philosophy on this blog to both evolve my own ideas
    by writing it down as well as explore new things that I would have previously not thought about.
  Not everything I write here will be representative of my viewpoints, however,
it is important to have an open mind when coming in and reading philosophy of this kind.
The term 'radical' should not be in your vocabulary ever as it inflicts a bias upon your views
and leaves you out from exploring new topics.
</td>
    <td>I only recently got into philosophy/critical theory (not even ~7 months ago), so, obviously my views will change
    and it is very likely that a lot of my viewpoints/references could be wrong. I am always open to criticisms and further information!</td>
